## Coding Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this project was to attempt and create a quiz using html,css and javascript. The motivation behind the production of this project was to try and challenge my capibilities with javascript to learn an improve my techniques with dom manipulation. The quiz solves the problem of having using an object as an array and being able to navigate through it, and to add event listeners. I learned many things during the creating of this project such as connected multiple html files together and use timers.
